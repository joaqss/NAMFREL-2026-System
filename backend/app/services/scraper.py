"""
News scraping service.

Ported from the original Supabase Edge Function (scrape-news). Most sources
are RSS feeds, which sidesteps CSS-selector scraping (and the "sites break
when they redesign" problem) entirely -- see _scrape_rss_source(). Sources
with no RSS feed (e.g. Luwaran, which is a custom CMS with no /feed/ at
all) use _scrape_html_source() instead, configured with a listing_url and
CSS selectors. Requires beautifulsoup4 (`pip install beautifulsoup4`),
which isn't needed by the plain RSS path. If either strategy fails, the
source is also tried with newspaper3k, which discovers article links and
extracts their metadata and text.

Bot-detection note: some sources (Manila Bulletin, ABS-CBN as of the last
check) return 403 Forbidden to plain httpx requests -- this is bot
protection, not a bad URL/feed. For those, this module fetches through a
real headless Chromium browser via Playwright instead of httpx, since a
real browser's TLS/JS fingerprint gets past checks a raw HTTP client can't.
Playwright is deliberately NOT used for every source -- it's much slower
per-request than httpx, so it's reserved for sources that are confirmed to
need it (see BROWSER_FETCH_SOURCES below) plus the HTML-listing path
(_scrape_html_source), which needs a rendered page regardless.

# --- Why a known-real BARMM article can still be "missed" ---
# Confirmed via `python -m app.services.scraper --debug`: general feeds like
# Rappler's /feed are a SITE-WIDE firehose capped at ~10 entries. When
# national news (e.g. an impeachment trial) dominates the cycle, a BARMM
# story can be published and then pushed out of that 10-item window before
# the next scrape ever sees it. This is NOT a keyword-filter bug.
#
# Two real fixes, not mutually exclusive:
#   1. Scrape more often (e.g. hourly cron instead of daily) so fewer items
#      have time to roll out of a small firehose window between runs. This
#      matters more now that the focus is the 2026 election cycle, since
#      election-day/results coverage moves fast.
#   2. Prefer sources that are already scoped to the region instead of
#      filtering a national firehose down after the fact -- e.g.:
#        https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/source/inquirer-mindanao (Inquirer)
#        https://mindanaogoldstardaily.com/category/barmm (Gold Star Daily)
#      Neither of these has a discovered RSS feed, so they'd need the
#      HTML listing_url + CSS selector approach instead of feedparser --
#      see _scrape_html_source() above for that pattern. This route
#      structurally can't lose an article to unrelated national news,
#      since nothing outside the region ever enters that feed to begin with.
#   3. Consider also checking COMELEC's own press releases/site once the
#      2026 BARMM election calendar is published -- official filings,
#      candidate lists, and results announcements often appear there before
#      (or instead of) general news coverage.
#
# (Google News RSS search was considered as a shortcut but its endpoint is
# disallowed by robots.txt -- using it risks the server's IP being blocked
# and is against Google's terms, so it's deliberately not used here.)
